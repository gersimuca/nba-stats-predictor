Welcome to the NBA Stats Predictor project!

## Overview

The NBA Stats Predictor is a tool designed for in-depth analysis and prediction of NBA player statistics. Leveraging historical data and a custom Scikit-learn machine learning model, this tool provides valuable insights and predictions related to NBA performance and outcomes.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction and Transformation**:
  - Executed data extraction and transformation processes by downloading relevant information as CSV files. This crucial initial step ensured that data was in a usable format for subsequent analysis.

- **Machine Learning Model Integration**:
  - Integrated the transformed data into a custom Scikit-learn machine learning model. This allowed for comprehensive analysis and prediction based on the collected NBA statistics, enabling data-driven insights.

- **Predictive Analysis**:
  - Utilized the machine learning model to conduct analysis and generate predictions based on NBA statistics. The project's primary goal is to provide valuable insights and predictions related to NBA performance and outcomes.
